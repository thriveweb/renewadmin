  Is your small business STP ready? From 1 July 2019 employers with less than 19
  employees are required to report wages and superannuation paid to employees to
  the ATO each time they run their payroll and pay their staff using Single
  Touch Payroll (“STP”)

By reporting through Single Touch Payroll, this relieves employers from completing annual PAYG Payment Summaries at year end as the ATO will already have this information from the employer and individuals will have this available to them via MyGov (if they are registered for MyGov). Employers will be required to submit a finalisation declaration to the ATO by 14 July each year using STP and provide annual PAYG Payment Summaries to employees (if they chose to).



Single Touch Payroll is also another measure to ensure employees are receiving the correct amount of salary and wages and superannuation paid to them. Employees will also be able to access information more readily, in particular superannuation as superfunds are now obliged to report to the ATO each time they receive a superannuation payment for a particular individual.



From 2020, the ATO will start to prefill activity statement labels W1 and W2 for small to medium withholders (withholders of between $1- $1 million annually) which will assist with BAS and IAS preparation for businesses.
